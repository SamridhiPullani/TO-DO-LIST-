DOMAIN: PYTHON PROGRAMMING

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

This project is a simple command-line based To-Do List application developed using Python. It allows users to efficiently manage their daily tasks by providing options to add new tasks, view the existing list, and mark tasks as completed without removing them. Each task is displayed with a status indicator — either "✅ Done" or "❌ Not Done" — making it easy to track progress. The program uses basic Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, lists, and dictionaries, making it an ideal project for beginners who are learning how to build interactive applications in Python. Since it runs directly in the terminal and does not require any external libraries or file storage, it is lightweight and easy to use. This to-do list is a great starting point for those interested in developing practical tools with Python and can be extended further with features like file saving, deadlines, or a graphical interface.
